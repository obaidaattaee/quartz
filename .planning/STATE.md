## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: 4-phase coarse roadmap derived from 67 v1 requirements. Foundation first to avoid RTL retrofit. Public site before admin to validate data models. Blog/portfolio last because it depends on admin CMS.
- [Phase 01]: Removed viewTransition defaults from createInertiaApp due to Inertia v3 type limitations -- viewTransition available per-Link/visit instead
- [Phase 01]: Self-hosted fonts via @fontsource-variable instead of CDN (fonts.bunny.net) for reliability and performance
- [Phase 01]: RTL breadcrumb flip uses both Tailwind rtl: variant and CSS fallback for maximum compatibility
- [Phase 01]: 404 page renders standalone without layout via Inertia exception handler in bootstrap/app.php

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Research]: Tiptap RTL has known issues (GitHub #3957). TextDirection extension needs validation before Phase 4 blog work.
- [Research]: Arabic font subsetting (200-500KB fonts) needs investigation during Phase 1 typography work.
- [Research]: GSAP ScrollTrigger.refresh() hook placement after Inertia page loads needs validation during Phase 1/2 animation work.
